In this sense there is a loss of information due to this \"filtering\" process.\n",

The *bad news* is that classical tests depend on underlying assumptions (e.g., normality,linearity), and hence the validity of the test conclusions becomes dependent on the validity of the underlying assumptions. Worse yet, the exact underlying assumptions may be unknown to the analyst, or if known, untested. Thus the validity of the scientific conclusions becomes intrinsically linked to the validity of the underlying assumptions. In practice, if such assumptions are unknown or untested, the validity of the scientific conclusions becomes suspect.\n",

    "### How Does Exploratory Data Analysis Differ from Descriptive Analysis?\n",
    "#### Descriptive Analysis\n",
    "A summary/descriptive analysis is simply a numeric reduction of a historical data set. It is quite passive. Its focus is in the past. Quite commonly, its purpose is to simply arrive at a few key statistics (for example, mean and standard deviation) which may then either replace the data set or be added to the data set in the form of a summary table.\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample data and the measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four major types of descriptive statistics:\n",
    "- Measures of Frequency: Count, Percent, Frequency. ...\n",
    "- Measures of Central Tendency:  Mean, Median, and Mode. ...\n",
    "- Measures of Dispersion or Variation:Range, Variance, Standard Deviation. ...\n",
    "- Measures of Position:Percentile Ranks, Quartile Ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "In contrast, EDA has as its broadest goal the desire to gain insight into the engineering/scientific process behind the data. Whereas summary statistics are passive and historical, EDA is active and futuristic. In an attempt to \"understand\" the process and improve it in the future, EDA uses the data as a \"window\" to peer into the heart of the process that generated the data. There is an archival role in the research and manufacturing world for summary statistics, but there is an enormously larger role for the EDA approach."
