    "Insight implies detecting and uncovering underlying structure in the data. Such underlying structure may not be encapsulated in the list of items above; such items serve as the specific targets of an analysis, but the real insight and \"feel\" for a data set comes as the analyst judiciously probes and explores the various subtleties of the data. The \"feel\" for the data comes almost exclusively from the application of various graphical techniques, the collection of which serves as the window into the essence of the data. Graphics are irreplaceable--there are no quantitative analogues that will give the same insight as well-chosen graphics."
